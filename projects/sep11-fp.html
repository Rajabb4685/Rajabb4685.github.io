            <p>For this year's freedom project, we use javascript and p5js to make Keysanity a typing game. The purpose of our game is to help users type faster and more efficiently. I have realized even I myself am not that fast at type. A typing game was a very good idea to help me get better at typing. Being able to type fast is very good. it can help you maintain time better. Not only does it help you type faster. Our game is super fun and interactive. We built this game mostly using javascript for functions and p5js for visuals.      </p>
            <p>My group and I made a typing game and its name is Keysanity. itâ€™s super fun and interactive. it helps users get better at typing in a fun way. Our word selections include common words and more. Our game counts words per minute along with a score of how many words you try. We also have a sprite that moves when the score increase. </p>
            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>There were many challenges for example picking what to do. we begin the year with little knowledge about javascript so planning felt a little overwhelming but eventually, our game turned out exactly as we wanted. A lot of planning and design went on. Staying on track and asking for help has helped us get to perfect our project to the design we had in mind. </p>
            <p>Some takeaways were always at any time if need help asks for it. This really helped us to perfect our project and even go above our expectations. Another takeaway is to use time wisely and stay with the plan you made. </p>
            <p>Our next stops are to add a leaderboard where everyone's score is saved and displayed on our game. </p>
